## One-on-one meeting with James Porter 20170328

 * Recommendations for constructing my own "menu" of : _Effective JavaScript_ and the _You Don't Know JS_ series.
 * Node: very good for writing network services and especially glue between different network services.
 * Graphics libraries of possible interest, in addition to `d3.js` and `p5.js`:
   * paper.js
   * three.js
   * All those mentioned other than `d3.js` relies on `canvas`, which is also worth knowing.
 * React: the pain points are not the syntax but the tools. It isn't just a library; it's a set of ideas about building UIs.
