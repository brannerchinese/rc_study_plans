## One-on-one with James Porter, 20170501

I said that I had lost most of the two weeks since our last meeting to interview preparation. The one substantial thing I have gotten done since then was reading the SVG specification.

He suggests the next stage after my SVG/B⁺-tree project is one could be to write up what I've learned about B⁺-trees along with visualization. He also asked what sorts of things I might like to work on next; I said I thought I would try to implement the same sort of display with one or more graphics libraries, and after that see what other sorts of tree/graph projects I might find to apply the same tools to.
