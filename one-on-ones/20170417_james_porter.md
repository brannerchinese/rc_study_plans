## One-on-one meeting with James Porter, 20170417

I neglected to take notes on this at the time.

I talked about what I had learned about B⁺-trees, and how hard it was because so little was described anywhere. He said he thought it might be that some parts of database-learning are not widely described, and people may actually learn the details about them only by working on an actual database with an internal B⁺-tree implementation.
