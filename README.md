    2. projects

 1. The Graph abstract data-type and the Tree data-structure

 1. Environment
 
    2. Laptop options
    
       Chromebook, working on DigitalOcean instance, is a cheaper option than Dell. Acer Chromebook for Work has significantly fewer bad reviews on Amazon than Acer Chromebook 15. Not sure how happy I will be working full-time on a laptop again, but it's only for six weeks.
    
       3. Dell XPS 13.

       3. Acer Chromebook 15 CB5-571 C1DZ
       
          * http://www.linux-netbook.com/acer-chromebook-15-cb5-571-c1dz/
    
       3. Acer Chromebook for Work CP5-471-312N (14")
    
    2. OS options
    
       3. Crouton and MATE
       
          > Crouton allows you to install Ubuntu on your Chromebook (https://chromebook.guide/crouton/)

          > There are several releases of Linux Mint available, and MATE and Xfce are tied for best lightweight Linux Mint release. Both are well suited to Atom processors, and most under-powered CPUs for that matter. Of all the distributions on this list, Mint offers arguably the best looking environment. (http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-lightweight-linux-distros-ideal-intel-atom-processor-pc/)
          
          > There is a handy thing called Crouton that can be used to run Ubuntu alongside ChromeOS. In this article, I will walk through the steps required for accomplishing this. Crouton does not support Mate (my preferred desktop environment) out-of-the-box, so I will also walk through how to get Mate as well.
