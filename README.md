## Prospective study-tasks for RC batch Spring 2 '17

### Goals

 1. Fluency in JavaScript
 
    2. [reference](sections/fluency_in_js_reference.md)
    
    2. [projects](sections/fluency_in_js_projects.md)

 1. Philosophy
 
    2. [The Graph abstract data-type and the Tree data-structure](philosophy_graphs_trees.md)

 1. Other topics of interest

    2. composing makefiles
    2. fluency in Bash scripting
    2. use of Docker containers

### Environment
 
I want very much to work in a pure Linux environment. During my first batch, I used Ubuntu under VirtualBox on Mac OS X, but I had a lot of trouble with the environment at times — I suppose I lost two weeks of the batch to pointless fiddling with problems I couldn't find the solutions to. Never again.
 
 1. Laptop options
    
    One option is to use a dedicated Linux machine and another is to work on remote Linux instance. Of the dedicated Linux machines, Dell machines seem more reliable than System 76. If I'm to work on remote instance, one option is to use my old MacBook and another is to get an inexpensive machine — a Chromebook is a cheaper option than Dell.

    Acer Chromebook for Work has significantly fewer bad reviews on Amazon than Acer Chromebook 15. 
    
    I'm not sure how happy I will be working full-time on a laptop again, but it's only for six weeks.
 
    2. Dell XPS 13.

    2. Acer Chromebook 15 CB5-571 C1DZ

    2. Acer Chromebook for Work CP5-471-312N (14")
 
 1. OS options
 
    2. Crouton and MATE
    
       > Crouton allows you to install Ubuntu on your Chromebook (https://chromebook.guide/crouton/)
       >
       > There are several releases of Linux Mint available, and MATE and Xfce are tied for best lightweight Linux Mint release. Both are well suited to Atom processors, and most under-powered CPUs for that matter. Of all the distributions on this list, Mint offers arguably the best looking environment.

       >
       > There is a handy thing called Crouton that can be used to run Ubuntu alongside ChromeOS. In this article, I will walk through the steps required for accomplishing this. Crouton does not support Mate (my preferred desktop environment) out-of-the-box, so I will also walk through how to get Mate as well.
