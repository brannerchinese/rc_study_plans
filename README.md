### Environment
 
I want very much to work in a pure Linux environment. During my first batch, I used Ubuntu under VirtualBox on Mac OS X, but I had a lot of trouble with the environment at times â€” I suppose I lost two weeks of the batch to pointless fiddling with problems I couldn't find the solutions to. Never again.
