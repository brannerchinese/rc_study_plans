### Environment
 
I want very much to work in a pure Linux environment. During my first batch, I used Ubuntu under VirtualBox on Mac OS X, but I had a lot of trouble with the environment at times — I suppose I lost two weeks of the batch to pointless fiddling with problems I couldn't find the solutions to. Never again.
 
 1. Laptop options
    
    One option is to use a dedicated Linux machine and another is to work on remote Linux instance. Of the dedicated Linux machines, Dell machines seem more reliable than System 76. If I'm to work on remote instance, one option is to use my old MacBook and another is to get an inexpensive machine — a Chromebook is a cheaper option than Dell.

    [Acer Chromebook for Work](https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Chromebook-Memory-Storage-CP5-471-581N/product-reviews/B01EPZIMD2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt_rgt?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=critical&reviewerType=avp_only_reviews&pageNumber=1) ([2](https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Chromebook-Memory-Storage-CP5-471-312N/product-reviews/B01F8NNY0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt_rgt?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=critical&reviewerType=avp_only_reviews)) has reviews on Amazon that are less noticeably bad than [Acer Chromebook 15](https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Chromebook-CB5-571-362Q-15-6-Inch-Intel/product-reviews/B00X5X30V0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt_rgt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=avp_only_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1) ([2](https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Chromebook-CB5-571-58HF-15-6-Inch-Intel/product-reviews/B00X5X2Z66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt_rgt?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=critical&reviewerType=avp_only_reviews&pageNumber=1) does. The 15 is clearly a more cheaply made machine, in any case; the "for work" is meant for businesses.
    
    I'm not sure how happy I will be working full-time on a laptop again, but it's only for six weeks.

 1. OS options
 
    2. Crouton
    
       > Crouton allows you to install Ubuntu on your Chromebook (https://chromebook.guide/crouton/, accessed 20170213)
       > 
       > crouton is a set of scripts that bundle up into an easy-to-use, Chromium OS-centric chroot generator. (https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton, accessed 20170213)
       >
       > **chroot**: A chroot on Unix operating systems is an operation that changes the apparent root directory for the current running process and its children. A program that is run in such a modified environment cannot name (and therefore normally cannot access) files outside the designated directory tree. The term "chroot" may refer to the chroot(2) system call or the chroot(8) wrapper program. The modified environment is called a chroot jail. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot, accessed 20170213)

    2. MATE

       > There are several releases of Linux Mint available, and MATE and Xfce are tied for best lightweight Linux Mint release. Both are well suited to Atom processors, and most under-powered CPUs for that matter. Of all the distributions on this list, Mint offers arguably the best looking environment. (http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-lightweight-linux-distros-ideal-intel-atom-processor-pc/, accessed 20170213)
       >
       > There is a handy thing called Crouton that can be used to run Ubuntu alongside ChromeOS. In this article, I will walk through the steps required for accomplishing this. Crouton does not support Mate (my preferred desktop environment) out-of-the-box, so I will also walk through how to get Mate as well.
