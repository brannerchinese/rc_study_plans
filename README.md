## Prospective study-tasks for RC batch Spring 2 '17

### Goals

 1. Fluency in JavaScript
 
    2. [reference](sections/fluency_in_js_reference.md)
    
    2. [projects](sections/fluency_in_js_projects.md)

 1. Philosophy
 
    2. [The Graph abstract data-type and the Tree data-structure](philosophy_graphs_trees.md)

### Environment
 
 1. Laptop options
    
    Chromebook, working on DigitalOcean instance, is a cheaper option than Dell. Acer Chromebook for Work has significantly fewer bad reviews on Amazon than Acer Chromebook 15. Not sure how happy I will be working full-time on a laptop again, but it's only for six weeks.
 
    2. Dell XPS 13.

    2. Acer Chromebook for Work CP5-471-312N (14")
 
 1. OS options
 
    2. Crouton and MATE
    
       > Crouton allows you to install Ubuntu on your Chromebook (https://chromebook.guide/crouton/)

       > There are several releases of Linux Mint available, and MATE and Xfce are tied for best lightweight Linux Mint release. Both are well suited to Atom processors, and most under-powered CPUs for that matter. Of all the distributions on this list, Mint offers arguably the best looking environment. (http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-lightweight-linux-distros-ideal-intel-atom-processor-pc/)

       > There is a handy thing called Crouton that can be used to run Ubuntu alongside ChromeOS. In this article, I will walk through the steps required for accomplishing this. Crouton does not support Mate (my preferred desktop environment) out-of-the-box, so I will also walk through how to get Mate as well.
