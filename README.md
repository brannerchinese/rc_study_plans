 1. The Graph abstract data-type and the Tree data-structure

    2. **Niklaus Wirth**, _Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs_. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1976.
    
       Examples are written in **PASCAL**, with a parser introduced in Chapter 5 for **PL/0**. Topics of special interest:
       
       * Chapter 4, "Dynamic Information Structures"
       
         * 4.4 "Tree Structures"
         * 4.5 "Multiway Trees"

       * Chapter 5, "Language Structures and Compilers"
       
         * 5.3 "Constructing a Syntax Graph"

    2. **Alfred V. Aho, John E. Hopcroft, and Jeffrey D. Ullman**, _Data Structures and Algorithms_. Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, 1983.
    
       Examples are written in "**super Pascal**", a superset of Pascal with three additional features: non-numeric labels, return statements, and expressions as names of types. Topics of interest to me are integrated with the treatment of sets, but the chapters of immediate interest to me are:
    
       * Chapter 3, "Trees"
       * Chapter 5, "Advanced Set Representation Methods" (includes binary search trees, tries, balanced tree implementations of sets)
       * Chapter 6, "Directed Graphs"
       * Chapter 6, "Undirected Graphs"

 1. Environment
 
    2. Laptop options
    
       Chromebook, working on DigitalOcean instance, is a cheaper option than Dell. Acer Chromebook for Work has significantly fewer bad reviews on Amazon than Acer Chromebook 15. Not sure how happy I will be working full-time on a laptop again, but it's only for six weeks.
    
       3. Dell XPS 13.
       
          * http://www.zdnet.com/article/2017s-best-linux-laptop-the-latest-dell-xps-13/

       3. Acer Chromebook 15 CB5-571 C1DZ
       
          * http://www.linux-netbook.com/acer-chromebook-15-cb5-571-c1dz/
    
       3. Acer Chromebook for Work CP5-471-312N (14")
    
    2. OS options
    
       3. Crouton and MATE
       
          > Crouton allows you to install Ubuntu on your Chromebook (https://chromebook.guide/crouton/)

          > There are several releases of Linux Mint available, and MATE and Xfce are tied for best lightweight Linux Mint release. Both are well suited to Atom processors, and most under-powered CPUs for that matter. Of all the distributions on this list, Mint offers arguably the best looking environment. (http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-lightweight-linux-distros-ideal-intel-atom-processor-pc/)
          
          > There is a handy thing called Crouton that can be used to run Ubuntu alongside ChromeOS. In this article, I will walk through the steps required for accomplishing this. Crouton does not support Mate (my preferred desktop environment) out-of-the-box, so I will also walk through how to get Mate as well.
