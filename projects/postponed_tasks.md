## Postponed tasks

**JS Track — libraries — graphical**

 * [　] List made of major libraries of interest. No further work to be done on them for now.

**JS Track — libraries — functional**

 * [　] Read Coulman's Ramda blogposts. **Postponed** after completing two. It's too early to be spending time with these.

**Concurrency/Distributed/Raft track**

 * [　] List made of items of interest. It seems likely that most of this work will be reading rather than implementation. In any  case, there is nothing more to do now but slowly assemble references.
