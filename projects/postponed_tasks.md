## Current and Postponed tasks

Postponed tasks are marked [Ｏ].

**JS track**

 * [Ｏ] List made of major JS graphical libraries of interest. No further work to be done on them for now.

 * [Ｏ] Read Coulman's Ramda.JS blogposts. **Postponed** after completing two. It's too early to be spending time with these.

**Database infrastructure/Raft track**

 * [　] Read next document in list. (Probably NoSQL paper.)

 * [Ｏ] List made of items of interest. It seems likely that most of this work will be reading rather than implementation. In any  case, there is nothing more to do now but slowly assemble references.

**Environment track**

 * [　] Supply a MWE of an IBus Chinese IME to @saul for his debugging with `i3`.

 * [　] Post IBus issue about lack of menu control.
 
 * [　] Examine *Seven Concurrency Models in Seven Weeks*. **Disposition**: Book located; not yet opened.
