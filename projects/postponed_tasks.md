## Current and Postponed tasks

Postponed tasks are marked [Ｏ].

**JS track**

 * [　] Color-match iteration: set up a scoring mechanism and display.
 * [　] Color-match iteration: add a graphical picker.

 * [Ｏ] Read Coulman's Ramda.JS blogposts. **Postponed** after completing two. It's too early to be spending time with these.

**Database infrastructure/Raft track**

 * [　] Read next document in list. (Probably NoSQL paper.)

 * [Ｏ] List made of items of interest. It seems likely that most of this work will be reading rather than implementation. In any  case, there is nothing more to do now but slowly assemble references.

**Environment track**

 * [　] One or two of the documents in the repo may be suitable for quick rewriting as blog posts.
 * [　] Update the Unicode codepoint flashcards, though I'm not at the point of wanting to use them. Add first change-log entry to head of `.tex` file.
