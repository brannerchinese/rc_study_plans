## Current and Postponed tasks

Postponed tasks are marked [Ｏ].

**JS track**

 * [　] Begin first JS project and ideally get minimal demo working in one day. If you can find a whole day in which to work on this, you knucklehead.

 * [Ｏ] List made of major JS graphical libraries of interest. No further work to be done on them for now.

 * [Ｏ] Read Coulman's Ramda.JS blogposts. **Postponed** after completing two. It's too early to be spending time with these.

**Database infrastructure/Raft track**

 * [　] Read next document in list. (Probably NoSQL paper.)

 * [Ｏ] List made of items of interest. It seems likely that most of this work will be reading rather than implementation. In any  case, there is nothing more to do now but slowly assemble references.

**Environment track**

 * [　] Moral invoicing parleys planned for today. (Have not done any in a few days).
 
 * [　] Supply a MWE of an IBus Chinese IME to @saul for his debugging with `i3`.

 * [　] Repository's "postponed tasks" page should also keep a full list of tasks I consider current, since they tend to get lost on Zulip.
 
 * [　] Post IBus issue about lack of menu control.
 
 * [　] Examine *Seven Concurrency Models in Seven Weeks*.
