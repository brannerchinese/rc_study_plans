## Current and Postponed tasks

### Current tasks

**JS track**

 * [　] Begin first JS project and ideally get minimal demo working in one day. If you can find a whole day in which to work on this, you knucklehead.

**Database infrastructure track**

 * [　] Read next document in list. (Probably NoSQL paper.)
 
**Environment**

 * [　] Moral invoicing parleys planned for today. (Have not done any in a few days).
 
 * [　] Supply a MWE of an IBus Chinese IME to @saul for his debugging with `i3`.

 * [　] Repository's "postponed tasks" page should also keep a full list of tasks I consider current, since they tend to get lost on Zulip.
 
 * [　] Post IBus issue about lack of menu control.

### Postponed tasks

**JS Track — libraries — graphical**

 * [　] List made of major libraries of interest. No further work to be done on them for now.

**JS Track — libraries — functional**

 * [　] Read Coulman's Ramda blogposts. **Postponed** after completing two. It's too early to be spending time with these.

**Concurrency/Distributed/Raft track**

 * [　] List made of items of interest. It seems likely that most of this work will be reading rather than implementation. In any  case, there is nothing more to do now but slowly assemble references.
