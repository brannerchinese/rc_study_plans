## Current and Postponed tasks

Postponed tasks are marked [Ｏ].

### **JS track**

 * [Ｏ] Try out the preferred TDD options for JavaScript: UnitJS and SinonJS. 

#### **Color-match project**

 * [　] Color-match iteration 10: Can you display hues of individual channel-fields? After this, time to work on actual color-match game.
 * [　] Color-match iteration: Try on other browsers.

 * [Ｏ] Color-match iteration: add a graphical picker (try for three linear sliders, one for each of RGB). This seems a lot more complicated than I had thought. Study the W3Schools implementation:

   * page: https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp
   * JS: https://www.w3schools.com/lib/w3color.js

 * [Ｏ] Color-match iteration: after graphical picker has been added, allow user to toggle numeric display on and off for learning.

#### Reading and workshops

 * [　] Start reading about major JS graphical libraries of interest, beginning with list made earlier.

 * [　] Read the [MDN article-series on Accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility) (note that the second-to-last item has a broken link to the last item)

   * [　] (Part of the above). Read about [ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/WAI-ARIA_basics).

 * [　] Read the [MDN article-series on Client-side web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs) (incomplete; "Video and audio APIs" is still in draft, and "Device APIs" and "Client-side storage APIs" are not posted)
 
   * [　] (Part of the above). Read the [MDN article on manipulating DOM elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents).

 
 * [　] Read next chapter in JS books.
 * [Ｏ] List made of major JS graphical libraries of interest. No further work to be done on them for now.
 * [Ｏ] Read Coulman's Ramda.JS blogposts. **Postponed** after completing two. It's too early to be spending time with these.

### **Database infrastructure/Raft track**

 * [　] Read Paul Butcher, *Seven Concurrency Models in Seven Weeks*. 

 * [　] Read next document in list. (Probably NoSQL paper.)

### **Environment track**
 
 * [　] One or two of the documents in the repo may be suitable for quick rewriting as blog posts.

 * [　] Supply a MWE of an IBus Chinese IME to @saul for his debugging with `i3`. I need to figure out how to take a screen shot in order to be sure of what I've done; also, there are a few more font-size options to be tried first.

 * [　] Post IBus issue about lack of menu control.
