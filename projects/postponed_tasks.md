## Current and Postponed tasks

Postponed tasks are marked [Ｏ].

**JS track**

 * [　] Try out the preferred TDD options for JavaScript: UnitJS and SinonJS.
 * [　] Color-match iteration: addition of user and program values. We also need a "palindrome modulus" — is that a term? Ordinary modulus is plots as a sawtooth wave; here I need a single period of a triangle wave: `adjusted = sum<=255 ? sum : 510-sum`.
 * [　] Color-match iteration: set up a scoring mechanism and display.
 * [　] Color-match iteration: add a graphical picker.
 * [　] Color-match README (now that repository has been created).
 * [　] Read next chapter in JS books.


 * [Ｏ] List made of major JS graphical libraries of interest. No further work to be done on them for now.

 * [Ｏ] Read Coulman's Ramda.JS blogposts. **Postponed** after completing two. It's too early to be spending time with these.

**Database infrastructure/Raft track**

 * [　] Read next document in list. (Probably NoSQL paper.)

 * [Ｏ] List made of items of interest. It seems likely that most of this work will be reading rather than implementation. In any  case, there is nothing more to do now but slowly assemble references.

**Environment track**

 * [　] One or two of the documents in the repo may be suitable for quick rewriting as blog posts.

 * [　] Supply a MWE of an IBus Chinese IME to @saul for his debugging with `i3`. I need to figure out how to take a screen shot in order to be sure of what I've done; also, there are a few more font-size options to be tried first.

 * [　] Post IBus issue about lack of menu control.
 
 * [　] Examine *Seven Concurrency Models in Seven Weeks*. **Disposition**: Book located; not yet opened.

### Non-batch work

**Translation of prosody paper**

 * [　] Edit remainder of Section 7 corrigenda and send to translator.

**"Face" book**

My collaborator feels well enough that on Friday she began criticizing my English again, for the first time in several years, and nagging me to get the book finished.

 * [　] Draft chapter on parts of speech and other conventions

 * [　] Pick up refactoring of old Python code: LaTeX-formatting of entries; handling of sentences; ordering of entries.
