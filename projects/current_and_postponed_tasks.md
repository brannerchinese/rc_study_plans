### Summary of the break between the two halves of my batch

(From my diary)

> I have had a two-week break in the midst of my batch. I gained a lot from it — one thing I did was to transcribe the whole _Tsyrchyuan_ of Yang Shuhdar (all the definitions), which meant that I read the whole thing carefully. The other was to put my RC experience in better focus — both the MongoDB interview experience and Nancy's suggestion that I take Myer-Briggs had a big effect on me.
