## Current and Postponed tasks

Postponed tasks are marked [Ｏ].

### **JS track**

 * [Ｏ] Try out the preferred TDD options for JavaScript: UnitJS and SinonJS. 

#### **Color-match project**

 * [　] Color-match iteration 10: Describe dimensions of circle relative to viewport, rather than absolutely.
 * [　] Color-match iteration 11: Can you display hues of individual channel-fields? After this, time to work on actual color-match game.
 * [　] Color-match iteration: Try on other browsers.

 * [Ｏ] Color-match iteration: add a graphical picker (try for three linear sliders, one for each of RGB). This seems a lot more complicated than I had thought. Study the W3Schools implementation :

   * page: https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp
   * JS: https://www.w3schools.com/lib/w3color.js
   
   and try to construct something simpler

 * [Ｏ] Color-match iteration: after graphical picker has been added, allow user to toggle numeric display on and off for learning.

#### **B-tree implementation**

It would be nice to try this with [d3.js](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki).

#### **Hànbûn columns project**

This shouldn't take more than two good days of work.

 * [　] Hànbûn columns iteration: Make resizable frame no larger than open window/viewport.
 * [　] Hànbûn columns iteration: Within frame, create columnar subframes that wrap right-left.
 * [　] Hànbûn columns iteration: Populate subframes with characters, one to a row.
 * [　] Hànbûn columns iteration: Load page into iframe from elsewhere.

#### Reading and workshops

 * [　] Start reading about major JS graphical libraries of interest, beginning with list made earlier.

 * [　] Read the [MDN article-series on Accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility) (note that the second-to-last item has a broken link to the last item)

   * [　] (Part of the above). Read about [ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/WAI-ARIA_basics).

 * [　] Read the [MDN article-series on Client-side web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs) (incomplete; "Video and audio APIs" is still in draft, and "Device APIs" and "Client-side storage APIs" are not posted)
 
   * [　] (Part of the above). Read the [MDN article on manipulating DOM elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents).

 
 * [　] Read next chapter in JS books.
 * [Ｏ] List made of major JS graphical libraries of interest. No further work to be done on them for now.
 * [Ｏ] Read Coulman's Ramda.JS blogposts. **Postponed** after completing two. It's too early to be spending time with these.

### **Database infrastructure/Raft track**

 * [　] Read Paul Butcher, *Seven Concurrency Models in Seven Weeks*. 

 * [　] Read next document in list. (Probably NoSQL paper.)

 * [Ｏ] List made of items of interest. It seems likely that most of this work will be reading rather than implementation. In any  case, there is nothing more to do now but slowly assemble references.

### **RC togetherness**


### **Work-worry**

 * [Ｘ] Job profiles workshop at RC
 * [　] Compose new RC résumé
 * [　] Look into the companies listed as coming to the [April 20th, 2017](https://www.recurse.com/events/260) and [April 27th, 2017](https://www.recurse.com/events/261) job fairs
 * [　] Look up the company mentioned by Nancy Thomas
 * [　] Fix code-issues in blog — including list of past entries (long postponed)

### **Environment track**
 
 * [Ｘ] Rename `postponed_tasks.md`
 * [　] One or two of the documents in the repo may be suitable for quick rewriting as blog posts.

 * [　] Supply a MWE of an IBus Chinese IME to @saul for his debugging with `i3`. I need to figure out how to take a screen shot in order to be sure of what I've done; also, there are a few more font-size options to be tried first.

 * [　] Post IBus issue about lack of menu control.
 
### Non-batch work

**Translation of prosody paper**

 * [　] Edit remainder of Sections 7 & 8 corrigenda and send to translator. There are also his revisions to look at.

**"Face" book**

My collaborator feels well enough that on Friday she began criticizing my English again, for the first time in several years, and nagging me to get the book finished.

 * [　] Draft chapter on parts of speech and other conventions

 * [　] Pick up refactoring of old Python code: LaTeX-formatting of entries; handling of sentences; ordering of entries.
