## Prospective coding projects for RC batch Spring 2 '17

### Current

 1. [reST and Sphinx](sphinx.md)

### Postponed after first half-batch

 1. [Color match](color-match.md): functionality for "Color-match game". **Disposition**: 20170413: Iteration 9 under way.
 1. [B+ tree](b-trees.md)

### Future

 1. [Hànbûn tool](hanbun-columns.md). With CSS3 features, now seems much simpler than I had expected. Postpone.
 1. [Boustrophedon](boustrophedon.md). With CSS3 features, now seems much simpler than I had expected. Postpone.
 1. [Color-match game](color-match-game.md): game using `color-match` functionality.
 1. [Unicode codepoint-by-name-lookup tool](codepoint-by-character-name.md)

Other ideas:
