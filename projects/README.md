## Prospective coding projects for RC batch Spring 2 '17

 1. Color-matching functionality. (JS). Computer selects a random color and user must select a color that, added to the computer's color, comes as close as possible to white. Further items:
 
    1. Randomly select RGB separately? Or just choose a random integer up to 16777215 (== 0xffffff) and convert to hex?
    1. In order to practice storage algorithms, keep track of colors with poorest performance and report stats?
 
 1. Color-matching game. (JS). Use earlier functionality to make a game — player is confronted with object (eventually, objects) of random color, and must "match to white" as above in order to neutralize it. Further items:
 
    1. Make into a distributed game?

 1. B+ tree. (JS). Use a graphical library to show it. Further items:
 
    1. Can we show its construction, step by step?
 
 1. Hànbûn tool. (JS). Input text and have computer set it in right-to-left columns. Further items:
 
    1. Must wrap and scroll properly. 
    1. Instead of text, allow link to news site?
