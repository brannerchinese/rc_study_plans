## Differences between Raft algorithm and MongoDB's "replica set" model. 

### Main points 

 * MongoDB's Protocol v. 0 was "inherently unsafe" (Jepsen) but as Protocol v. 1 it has now been improved and further patched.

 * Protocol v. 0:
 
   * [It] "does not provide consensus; it relies on synchronized clocks, and even where clocks are synchronized, can become skewed when many operations arrive at the same timestamp." (Jepsen)
   * "This is a design flaw of the v0 replication protocol itself, not a bug; there are no plans to fix it. â€¦ The solution is to switch to MongoDB's newer replication protocol: v1." (Jepsen)
 
 * Protocol v. 1 has adopted features from Raft:

   * "terms": Voting rounds now occur only once per term (Jepsen); once per election *attempt* (Brody); in v. 0 the number of votes was configurable (Stennie).

     * `optime` is now tuple `[term, timestamp]`; "term" ensures logical instead of temporal priority; timestamps still serve as log indices, unlike in Raft (Jepsen).
     * `oplog` "is, in essence, a sparse Raft log" (Jepsen).
   
   * Monitoring node status using metadata sent via existing data replication channel, rather than from every node to every other node (Brody).
   * Heartbeats now faster (Brody).
   * Asymmetric election timeouts (Brody).

 * Distinctive MongoDB replication characteristics still in place:
 
   * Operations are applied as soon as received, rather than only after committal (Jepsen).
   * effects of dirty reads are attenuated with (Jepsen):
   
     * snapshots of last committed state
     * "majority read concern": reads from committed snapshot
     * "linearizable read concern": read is done by primary from own, uncommitted state, and primary then blocks until committal

   * Candidacy of MongoDB "primary" is decided based on `priority`; in Raft any "follower" may elect to become candidate for election (Raina).
   * MongoDB has "hidden members", used for reporting and back-up but not serving queries or becoming "primaries"; they may or may not participate in an election (Raina).
   * Durability is ensured via "write concern" (level of acknowledgement for replicated data from the `oplog`) and "journaling" (write-ahead logging, on-disk) (Raina). Perhaps it is better to use only one of `oplog` and journal, not both (Bond).
