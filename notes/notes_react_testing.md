## Testing in react

Carolina Hadad, Recurse Center JS/Webstack Topics workshop, 20170412.

Test frameworks: `jest`, `sinon`, `enzyme`.

Enzyme's `shallow` enables you to test things related to a component alone, without a child component's behavior. 

Enzyme's `mount` simulates everything.

Sinon allows a `spy` method, allowing a count of the number of calls to a function and simulate clicks, etc.

Jest allows repositories to show coverage and whether tests pass or not. They integrate with other tools for continuous integration.
