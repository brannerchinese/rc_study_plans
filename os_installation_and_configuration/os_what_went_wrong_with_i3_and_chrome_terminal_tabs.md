## What went wrong with `i3` and Chrome terminal tabs

After initially planning to use `i3` as my normal coding environment, I found that I could do a lot of what I wanted in the "terminal" tabs of Chrome OS itself.

Eventually, though, I discovered that the OS's own browser could not open files other than those in Downloads or Google Drive; that it was impossible to open graphical windows from the chroot; that there were problems both entering and displaying Unicode cleanly at the command line; and that IBus did not work at the command line.

Some of these problems were solved in `i3`, but the problems of both Unicode input and IBus seemed insoluble. Installing the `Mat√©`desktop seems to have solved all the problems. It took me almost the first two weeks of batch to get everything working and documented.
