## Laptop options

One option is to use a dedicated Linux machine and another is to work on remote Linux instance. Of the dedicated Linux machines, Dell machines seem more reliable than System 76. If I'm to work on remote instance, one option is to use my old MacBook and another is to get an inexpensive machine â€” a Chromebook is a cheaper option than Dell.

[Acer Chromebook for Work](https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Chromebook-Memory-Storage-CP5-471-581N/product-reviews/B01EPZIMD2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt_rgt?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=critical&reviewerType=avp_only_reviews&pageNumber=1) ([2](https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Chromebook-Memory-Storage-CP5-471-312N/product-reviews/B01F8NNY0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt_rgt?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=critical&reviewerType=avp_only_reviews)) has reviews on Amazon that are less noticeably bad than [Acer Chromebook 15](https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Chromebook-CB5-571-362Q-15-6-Inch-Intel/product-reviews/B00X5X30V0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt_rgt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=avp_only_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1) ([2](https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Chromebook-CB5-571-58HF-15-6-Inch-Intel/product-reviews/B00X5X2Z66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt_rgt?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=critical&reviewerType=avp_only_reviews&pageNumber=1) does. The 15 is clearly a more cheaply made machine, in any case; the "for work" is meant for businesses.
    
I'm not sure how happy I will be working full-time on a laptop again, but it's only for six weeks.
 
 1. **Acer Chromebook for Work (14") CP5-471-312N (Intel Core i3)** or CP5-471-581N (Intel Core i5)

    2. **20170328: I ended up choosing this model. It is light and generally fun to use.** My only complaints are:
    
       * the trackpad is a little hesitant about clicks
       * the lightness of the machine itself makes it wobbly on my yoga-block standing-desk arrangement.
