## Micro SD options

**20170328: I ended up getting** a Samsung 128 Pro+. 

### Set `/home` always to be on the SD

 1. Method: apparently use `bind` in the `fstab`.
 1. Issues: If the SD is lost, can the system boot and how do I recover my content?

### Brands

These reviews date from 2015-16 and feature 64GB and smaller models. The newest brand names ("SanDisk Ultra", "Samsung Pro+") did not yet exist. Also, reliability is not tested for. It appears that Samsung and SanDisk have the best reputations.
