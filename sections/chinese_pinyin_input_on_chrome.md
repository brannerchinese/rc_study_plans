## Chinese Pinyin input on Chrome OS

To enter Unicode characters on Linux, enter `ctrl-shift-u` and the codepoint, and then return or space.

I will have to learn by heart the codepoints of the characters I use most often. It seems I can drop nay number of initial zeros.

　: u3000
Ｘ: uff38
Á: u00c1
á: u00e1
Ǎ: u01cd
ǎ: u01ce
É: u00c9
é: u00e9
Ě: u011a
ě: u011b
Ǐ: u01cf
ǐ: u01d0
Ǒ: u01d1
ǒ: u01d2
Ǔ: u01d3

### Older efforts

 * [Discussion of common non-ASCII characters](http://sites.hanovernorwichschools.org/techsupport/howtos/google/chromebook-accent-characters)

   This makes it look as though at least two different keyboards are needed to get both umlaut and the acute and grave accent marks, and macron and caron are not listed.

 * [UTF-8 extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/utf-8-and-unicode-charact/fcemphgmjnjpmmdhcedhjiegickfbiia/related?hl=en)

   This appears to supply mostly emoji.
