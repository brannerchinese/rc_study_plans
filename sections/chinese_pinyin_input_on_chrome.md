## Chinese Pinyin input on Chrome OS

 * [Discussion of common non-ASCII characters](http://sites.hanovernorwichschools.org/techsupport/howtos/google/chromebook-accent-characters)

   This makes it look as though at least two different keyboards are needed to get both umlaut and the acute and grave accent marks, and macron and caron are not listed.

 * [UTF-8 extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/utf-8-and-unicode-charact/fcemphgmjnjpmmdhcedhjiegickfbiia/related?hl=en)

   This appears to supply mostly emoji.

Probably I will have to add a font to Chrome -- more time required to understand that.
