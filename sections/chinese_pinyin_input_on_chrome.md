## Chinese Pinyin input on Chrome OS

To enter Unicode characters on Linux, enter `ctrl-shift-u` and the codepoint, and then return or space.

I will have to learn by heart the codepoints of the characters I use most often.

### Older efforts

 * [Discussion of common non-ASCII characters](http://sites.hanovernorwichschools.org/techsupport/howtos/google/chromebook-accent-characters)

   This appears to supply mostly emoji.
