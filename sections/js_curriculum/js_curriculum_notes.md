 * Void operator

 * Fn that returns no value can set variable to `"undefined"`

 * `typeof`

 * type of `null` is `"undefined"`

 * "Properties": object's elements. Also called "keys" when accessed by bracket operator.

 * Arrays and functions are subtypes of the object.

 * "Native": object wrapper around a primitive type. Capitalized.

 * "boxing": conversion of a primitive type to a native type.

 * Empty objects are `true`, not `false`.

 * Difference between `==` and `===`: `==` includes type coercion and `===` does not.
